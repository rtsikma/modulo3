Please note: This was coded and tested on Windows.

As such, there may be a some file loading errors that I was unable to test.

The following is an example usage:

in ...\modulo3\src\modulo3\

..\..\php\php run.php 1010100

I also ran manual tests with an no input parameter, 0, 1, and 123 to make sure run.php handled invalid input gracefully.
